**🔒 Enterprise Security** (SOC-2 Compliance)

## 3. Client Intake System (The Heart of Your Sales Process)

### What It Does (Simple Explanation)

Think of the intake system like a restaurant order form, but for websites:

**Traditional way** (like most developers):
- Customer says: "I want a website"
- You guess what they mean
- Lots of back-and-forth emails
- Often miss important requirements

**Your new system** (like a detailed restaurant order):
- Customer fills out comprehensive form
- Specifies budget, timeline, features wanted
- Describes their business and audience
- Lists technical requirements
- You get complete picture before quoting

### Technical Implementation

**Where the code lives:**
- Main form: `/src/app/intake/page.tsx`
- Form component: `/src/components/ProjectIntakeForm.tsx`  
- Processing logic: `/src/app/api/intake/route.ts`

**How it works technically:**
1. **Frontend Form** - Customer sees professional multi-step form
2. **Data Collection** - Form captures 40+ data points about their project
3. **Validation** - Ensures required fields are completed

## 5. Portfolio Demos (Your Professional Showcase)

### Why These Matter

Think of your portfolio like a restaurant's display case. Instead of telling customers "we make good food," you show them exactly what the food looks like.

**Instead of saying:** "I build websites"
