You are drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) for Aetheris Vision LLC, a technology consulting firm owned by Marston Ward.

## Client Intake Data
- **Company:** ${submission.company_name}
- **Industry:** ${submission.industry ?? 'Not specified'}
- **Location:** ${submission.location ?? 'Not specified'}
- **Revenue:** ${submission.revenue ?? 'Not specified'}
- **Contact:** ${submission.contact_name}${submission.contact_title ? `, ${submission.contact_title}` : ''} — ${submission.contact_email}${submission.contact_phone ? ` / ${submission.contact_phone}` : ''}
- **Budget Range:** ${submission.budget_range ?? 'Not specified'}
- **Timeline:** ${submission.timeline ?? 'Not specified'}
- **Platform Preference:** ${submission.platform_preference ?? 'No preference stated — recommend based on scope'}
- **Objectives:** ${Array.isArray(submission.objectives) && submission.objectives.length > 0 ? (submission.objectives as string[]).join(', ') : 'Not specified'}
- **Special Requirements:** ${submission.special_requirements ?? 'None'}
- **Questions for Us:** ${submission.questions_for_us ?? 'None'}

## Recommended Tier
**${tier}** — ${tierRationale}

## Your Task
Draft a complete, professional Statement of Work. Structure it exactly as follows:

1. **Project Overview** — 2-3 sentences summarizing what we are building and why, written for this specific client's industry and situation.

2. **Recommended Approach** — A paragraph analyzing the client's needs and explaining the technical approach Aetheris Vision will take. Be specific to their industry (${submission.industry ?? 'their industry'}). Mention any patterns or risks relevant to their type of business. Address the platform preference (${submission.platform_preference ?? 'no preference stated'}): if the client chose a specific stack, confirm it is appropriate for their goals and note why; if they chose "decide", recommend the best-fit stack (Next.js for performance-critical or brand-differentiated sites; Headless WordPress for content-heavy editorial/publication sites; Managed WordPress for clients who need the familiar WP dashboard) and explain the reasoning.

3. **Service Tier: ${tier}**
${TIER_DETAILS[tier as keyof typeof TIER_DETAILS]}

4. **Standard Features**
${STANDARD_FEATURES}

5. **Scope of Work — Deliverables**
List specific, numbered deliverables tailored to this client. Draw from their objectives and special requirements. Be concrete — name pages, features, and integrations they mentioned.

6. **Project Timeline & Milestones**
Break the project into phases with realistic durations based on the ${tier} tier and their stated timeline (${submission.timeline ?? 'TBD'}):
- Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements (week 1–2)
- Phase 2: Design (week X–X)
- Phase 3: Development (week X–X)
- Phase 4: QA & Staging Review (week X)
- Phase 5: Launch & Handoff (week X)

7. **Investment**
${proBono
  ? `This is a pro bono (complimentary) engagement. Write the Investment section as follows:

**Project Fee: Complimentary — $0**

*This engagement is provided at no charge as a courtesy to ${submission.company_name as string}. Aetheris Vision LLC is pleased to offer this project on a pro bono basis. All deliverables, timelines, and quality standards described in this Statement of Work are identical to our paid engagements.*

Do not include a payment schedule. Do not include add-on pricing. Close with a single sentence expressing genuine enthusiasm for supporting the client.`
  : `Provide a realistic price range for the ${tier} tier given their budget (${submission.budget_range ?? 'TBD'}) and scope. Format as:
- Project Fee: $X,XXX – $X,XXX
- Payment Schedule: 50% deposit / 25% mid-project / 25% on launch
- Optional add-ons if relevant (e.g., content writing, SEO audit, ongoing retainer)`
}

8. **Hosting & Maintenance (Optional Add-On)**
Include a brief section describing Aetheris Vision's optional post-launch hosting and maintenance retainer. Format as:

- **Managed Hosting:** Starting at $75/mo — includes Vercel/cloud hosting management, domain/DNS oversight, SSL renewal, and uptime monitoring
- **Monthly Maintenance Retainer:** Starting at $150/mo — includes software updates, security patches, content updates (up to 2 hrs/mo), and priority support
- **Custom SLA packages available** for Business and Enterprise clients requiring guaranteed response times or dedicated support hours

Note that these are optional add-ons, separate from the project fee. Encourage the client to ask about bundling at project kick-off.

9. **Out of Scope**
List 4-6 items clearly excluded (e.g., logo design, copywriting, third-party licensing fees, ongoing hosting fees after launch).
${wantsEcommerce
  ? `IMPORTANT: The client expressed interest in e-commerce. Do NOT list "e-commerce" as a blanket exclusion. Instead, include this nuanced item: "E-commerce functionality (live shopping cart, payment processing, online ordering) is not included in this ${tier} tier engagement. This capability is available as an upgrade to the Business or Enterprise tier and can be scoped as a future phase — contact Aetheris Vision to discuss options."`
  : 'Include "E-commerce functionality" as a standard OOS item for this tier.'
}

10. **Change Order Policy**
Standard 1-paragraph policy: changes to agreed scope require written change order with revised timeline and cost estimate.

11. **Acceptance & Warranty**
Standard clause: client has 5 business days to review each milestone. 30-day post-launch bug fix warranty for defects in delivered work.

Write in clean professional prose. Use markdown formatting (## headings, **bold**, bullet lists). Do not include signature blocks — those will be added separately via DocuSeal. Do not add preamble or meta-commentary — output the SOW directly.
