  },
  {
    q: "What technology do you use?",
    a: "Sites are built with Next.js (React) and Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. This gives you fast load times, excellent SEO, and a codebase you own entirely. No WordPress, no page builders, no lock-in.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I be able to edit the site myself?",
    a: "Yes. For content-heavy sites I integrate a headless CMS (like Sanity or Contentlayer) so you can edit text without touching code. For simpler sites I provide a walkthrough and the full source code.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you host the site?",
    a: "Sites are deployed to Vercel. The free tier covers most small business traffic. You own the deployment — I just set it up and hand it over.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you match our existing brand?",
    a: "Yes. Send your brand guide, logo files, or just describe the feel you're going for — I'll match it or propose something that fits.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this AI-generated slop?",
    a: "No. AI accelerates the workflow — layout ideation, copy drafts, component generation. Every site is reviewed, refined, and tested by a human engineer before it ships.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the Lighthouse 90+ guarantee?",
    a: "Every site is tested against Google Lighthouse before launch. I optimize images, code-split bundles, implement lazy loading, and configure caching to hit 90+ in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. You get the report.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I really get a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service?",
    a: "Yes. Every site includes a Privacy Policy page tailored to your business. Growth and Pro tiers also include Terms of Service and a cookie consent banner — no extra charge.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if my site goes down?",
    a: "Your site is backed up across GitHub and GitLab with full version history. If anything breaks, I can restore and redeploy within hours. Maintenance plan clients get proactive uptime monitoring and same-day response.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help with my Google Business Profile?",
    a: "Yes — included in the Pro tier. I'll connect your site to Google Business Profile so your business shows up in Google Maps with hours, reviews, and a link to your site.",
